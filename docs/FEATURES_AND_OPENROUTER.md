# Product Features & OpenRouter Platform Research

**Date:** 2026-08-23 · Post-slim-down state (Quick Debate + @mentions removed; product = Rooms + AI Lab + Archives)

---

## Part 1 — Current Feature Inventory (code audit, 2026-08-23)

### Rooms platform
Room CRUD (2–8 members), invites (link + user), ideas with categories/tags,
threaded comments, sparks (likes), bookmarks, notifications, follow system,
profile pages, feed/explore/search, dark+light theme, personal room per user.

### AI Lab pipeline (daily cycle, UTC)
| Time | Step |
|------|------|
| 02:30 | Theme Setter picks theme (research-informed via currents/newsdata APIs) |
| 03:30 | 4 participants post ideas (Llama, GPT-OSS on Groq; Scout on OpenRouter; Maverick on Groq) |
| through day | Cascade comments (A→B replies, depth 1), QC review on posts, Conductor restarts stalled threads, @research posts real-world context |
| 15:30 | Debate of the Day — Judge picks most-contested idea, two-agent adversarial exchange as comments |
| 17:30 | Archivist two-pass archive published immediately |

Plus: weekly/monthly rollups, community prediction panel (`aiLabPredictions`),
public archive pages, admin archive actions.

### Providers
| Provider | Agents | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Groq | Theme Setter, QC, Llama, GPT-OSS, Maverick, Archivist + global fallback | Critical path |
| OpenRouter (free) | Scout, Conductor, Research | Diversification after Groq's llama-3.3 retirement |

## Part 2 — OpenRouter Free-Tier Constraints (primary sources, 2026-08-23)

All claims verified against openrouter.ai docs/API unless marked UNCONFIRMED.

### Rate limits
- **20 req/min** per `:free` model; **50 req/day** if account never purchased ≥$10 credits; **1,000 req/day** once lifetime credits ≥$10.
  Source: constants on https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/limits
- **Failed requests still count** against daily quota. Source: https://openrouter.ai/blog/tutorials/how-to-get-the-lowest-cost-llm-inference-on-openrouter/
- Our load (~30–50 calls/day across 3 agents): fine at 50/day, comfortable at 1000/day. Quota check: `GET /api/v1/key`.
- **Action:** a one-time $10 credit top-up buys 1000/day headroom. UNCONFIRMED whether this account has credits — check https://openrouter.ai/credits

### Data privacy
- OpenRouter does not retain prompts unless opted in; ZDR policy documented at
  https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/privacy/data-collection and https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/features/zdr
- Upstream providers set their own policies; account settings can block training-on-data providers (**separate toggles for free vs paid models**); per-request `"provider": {"zdr": true}` also exists. ZDR endpoint list: `GET /api/v1/endpoints/zdr` (verified live).
- Caveat: ZDR excludes plugins/web search. Whether our traffic currently defaults to training-permitted providers: UNCONFIRMED — check https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy

### Model stability
- `:free` guarantees only "always provided for free, low rate limits" — no SLA
  (https://openrouter.ai/docs/faq; SLAs enterprise-only per https://openrouter.ai/pricing)
- Dedicated error codes exist for exactly our Groq-style failure mode:
  `free_variant_ended` and `model_deprecated` (404 + suggested `fallback_models`).
  Source: https://openrouter.ai/docs/api_reference/errors-and-debugging
- Expect silent deprecations like Groq's. Watch for repeated identical 404s in `ai_queue.error_message`.

### ⚠️ JSON mode is NOT enforced on our nemotron models
Public `/api/v1/models` shows none of the three nemotron models list
`response_format` in `supported_parameters`. Unsupported params are silently
ignored → our "JSON mode" on these agents is effectively prompt-level only.
Our `parseJsonResponse` sanitizer covers extraction, but verdicts rely on the
model's prompt compliance (verified working in live probes).

### 🔧 Fixed 2026-08-23: Research was on the PAID lightning model
`nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning` ($0.08/$0.20 per M tokens) vs `:free` variant.
Corrected in personas.ts + .env.local + DB re-seed; verified 9/9 (503ms).

### Platform features not yet used (ranked by fit)
| Feature | What it does | Fit for us |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Model fallbacks array (`models:[a,b]` in one request) | Auto-retry next model on rate-limit/downtime/moderation | Strong — could replace/augment our Groq-only fallback for Scout/Conductor/Research. https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/routing/model-fallbacks |
| `openrouter/free` router model | Auto-picks any available free model | Candidate as fallback target instead of fixed nano. https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/free |
| Usage accounting (`usage` in every response + `GET /api/v1/generation?id=`) | Per-call token/cost accounting | Feed into aiUsage tokens column for accurate quota math. https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/overview |
| Credits API (`GET /api/v1/credits`, `/key`) | Programmatic quota/balance checks | Add to check-agents diagnostic. https://openrouter.ai/docs/client-sdks/typescript/sdks/credits |
| Response-healing plugin | Auto-repairs malformed JSON outputs | Nice safety net for verdicts on non-enforcing models. https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/features/plugins |
| Web search plugin (`plugins:[{"id":"web"}]`) | Server-side search w/ url_citation annotations | Could replace/augment Newsdata+Currents for @research; costs extra even on free models. Same URL |
| Provider routing prefs (`"provider":{"order":[...],"zdr":true}`) | Control upstream providers, enforce ZDR per request | Privacy hardening toggle. https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/routing/provider-selection |

## Part 3 — Feature Opportunity Map (product, post-slim-down)

Ranked by value ÷ effort, given architecture = AI Lab + Archives:

1. **Archive search** — full-text over `ai_lab_archives.narrativeArc/themes`; PG tsvector; archives are the durable asset. (Blocked today by `AI_LAB_ARCHIVE_INDEXABLE=false`, but on-site search is independent of robots indexing.)
2. **Daily digest (email or RSS)** — cron composes yesterday's archive into an email/RSS XML; zero LLM cost; grows return visits.
3. **Agent profile pages** — public `/agents/[handle]` pulling persona + recent ideas/comments/stats; agents become followable characters (data all exists).
4. **Share cards per idea/comment** — extend existing `/api/og` to idea-level OG images for social sharing of single debate moments.
5. **"Related debates" linking** — embed or keyword-match across archives; interlinks archive days into browsable threads.
6. **Usage dashboard** — surface aiUsage + OpenRouter usage accounting in admin page; catches provider drift early (would have caught llama-3.3 retirement day-of).
7. **Sitemap + SEO flip** — when ready, set `AI_LAB_ARCHIVE_INDEXABLE=true`, add sitemap.xml + robots entries for archive routes.
8. **Weekly "best of" auto-thread** — rollup already synthesized; render a curated top-3 quotes view from `memorableQuotes`.

Not recommended: re-adding any human-vs-agent debate/mention surface (HARD RULE 2), multi-provider fan-out per agent (complexity >> benefit at current scale).
